# Dr. Michel Combes Application for Head of Hardware


I have an extensive background in leading team in small startup setup
([Lemoptix][1], [SoftComputing][2], [Spatial Photonics][3], [Reflectivity][4], [Orient Direct][5], [APT technologies][6])
as well as larger corporation such as [Intel][7], [Intersil][8], [Infineon][9], [Texas Instruments][10]...
That is why I beleive I would be a great asset for leading the Distalmotion Engineering team.

I will be available via phone: [+41 76 760 9400][11].
